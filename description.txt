brief description

1) dht11 sensor;
    this sensor has 3 pins. signal(data) pin,vcc and ground pin
    at the deep level the sensor is concept of MEMS(micro electro mechanical sensors)
    which are sensitive to surrounding pressure, humidity,temperature parameters.
    it is the air molecules between the physical and sensors which act as a bridge
    these molecules carry the surrounding parameters to the sensors.
2) lcd ;
    it is an 16x2 display(16 columns and 2 rows)
    the sensors values are fed to the arduino 
    and the arduino determines the constraints and displays
    the temperature and fan speed.
3)  arduino;
    it is mini computer of atmega 386 ic
    it has memory and ports where we burn the code written in c language.
